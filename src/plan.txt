so lets divide it into 4 parts
1) UI
2) SCORLLING ->THE WHOLE THING
3) THE DIFFERENT PAGES WE LAND ON
4) FINALLY, THE MUSIC PLAYER ITSELF


1)GOTTA BUILD IT BOSS, IDTS THERES ANOTHER WAY, CANT BE AN IMAGE FOR SURE, SINCE LIKE WE CANT DO THOSE ROTATIONS ON A JPEG, SHD
BE ON THE SCREEN ->SMORT ->OK LESS GET ON IT THEN

2) WE COULD USE ANGLES, LIKE KEEP THE CENTER AS ORIGIN, AND THE MOUSE POINTER AS THE OTHER END OF THE HYPO,
AND THEN USE TAN TO GET THE ANGLE, AND NOW FOR CHANGE IN THE ANGLE, AFTER A PARTICULAR RANGE, WE MOVE COMPARTMENTS
AND GOING ON THE REVERSE (THETA DECREASE), THE COMPARTMENTS ARE MOVED IN REVERSE
