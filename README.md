# INTRO

This was a project I took up from coding ninjas, and the goal was to make a web app using react, and also to explore new libraries which I havent done before this. Also towards the end, got to learn a lot about git and github, and also how to deploy pages on github. Here are some points worth mentioning

## Zing Touch

It was a library I used to read the scroll gestures to appropriately change pages.
Here are the [docs](https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch/)

## Netlify

I used [netlify](netlify.com) for the hosting. All I had to do was connect Netlify to the repository i was working on.
